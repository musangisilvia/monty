# Monty Interpreter


## *INTRODUCTION*

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes.
It relies on a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it.
By convention, the files containing Monty bytecodes have the *.m* extension. There is no more than one instruction per line  and there can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument.
